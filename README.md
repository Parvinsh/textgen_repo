This project is a **Streamlit-based application** that fetches information from web links, synthesizes it using a **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** approach, and allows users to interact with the content via a question-answering interface. Users can also save generated answers as a PDF for offline access.

## Features

- Fetch and clean content from multiple web links.
- Process and store content in a **vectorstore** for efficient retrieval.
- Leverage **Llama3** for answering user queries.
